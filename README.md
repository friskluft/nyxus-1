# Nyxus

A scalable library for calculating features from intensity-label image data

## Overview
Nyxus is a feature-rich, highly optimized, Python/C++ application capable of analyzing images of arbitrary size and assembling complex regions of interest (ROIs) split across multiple image tiles and files. This accomplished through multi-threaded tile prefetching and a three phase analysis pipeline shown below.

Nyxus can be used via Python or command line and is available in containerized form for reproducible execution. Nyxus computes over 450 combined intensity, texture, and morphological features at the ROI or whole image level with more in development. Key features that make Nyxus unique among other image feature extraction applications is its ability to operate at any scale, its highly validated algorithms, and its modular nature that makes the addition of new features straightforward.

## Getting started 

For use in python, the latest version of Nyxus can be installed via the [Pip package manager](https://pypi.org/project/pip):

```
pip install nyxus
```

Usage is very straightforward. Given `intensities` and `labels` folders, Nyxus pairs up intensity-label pairs and extracts features from them. A summary of the avaialble feature are [listed below](#available-features).

```python 
from nyxus import Nyxus

intensity_path = "/path/to/images/intensities/"
labels_path = "/path/to/images/labels/"

nyx = Nyxus(["*ALL*"])

features = nyx.featurize(intensity_path, labels_path)
```

The `features` variable is a Pandas dataframe similar to what is shown below.

|     | mask_image           | intensity_image      |   label |    MEAN |   MEDIAN |...|    GABOR_6 |
|----:|:---------------------|:---------------------|--------:|--------:|---------:|--:|-----------:|
|   0 | p1_y2_r51_c0.ome.tif | p1_y2_r51_c0.ome.tif |       1 | 45366.9 |  46887   |...|   0.873016 |

| ... | ...                  | ...                  |     ... | ...     |  ...     |...|   ...      |
| 734 | p5_y0_r51_c0.ome.tif | p5_y0_r51_c0.ome.tif |     223 | 54573.3 |  54573.3 |...|   0.980769 |

Nyxus can also be [built from source](#building-from-source) and used from the command line, or via a pre-built Docker container. 

## Available features 
The feature extraction plugin extracts morphology and intensity based features from pairs of intensity/binary mask images and produces a csv file output. The input image should be in tiled [OME TIFF format](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/ome-model/6.2.0/ome-tiff/specification.html).  The plugin extracts the following features:

Nyxus provides a set of pixel intensity, morphology, texture, intensity distribution features, digital filter based features and image moments

### Example: Running Nyxus to extract only intensity and basic morphology features

```
./nyxus --features=*all_intensity*,*basic_morphology* --intDir=/home/ec2-user/data-ratbrain/int --segDir=/home/ec2-user/data-ratbrain/seg --outDir=/home/ec2-user/work/output-ratbrain --filePattern=.* --csvFile=singlecsv 
```

## Building from source
To build Nyxus from source, make sure you clone the Github repository with the `--recurse-submodules` option to clone all the necessary dependencies.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/PolusAI/nyxus.git
```

Nyxus relies on [libTIFF](http://www.libtiff.org) as an external dependency which is readily available on most Unix-based OSs via the system package manager. 

For Debian-based distros, such as Ubuntu, this can be installed via:

```bash
sudo apt install libtiff-dev
```

For CentOS:
```bash
sudo yum install libtiff-devel
```

For Mac OSX (via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)):
```bash
brew install libtiff
```

Nyxus uses a CMake build system.
```bash
cd nyxus
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_CLI=ON ..
make -j4
```

Note that `-DBUILD_CLI=ON` tells Nyxus to build the command line interface as well. 

## Running via Docker 


docker pull container and run command. 
ANDRIY: FILL ME IN

The following command line is an example of running the dockerized feature extractor (image hash 87f3b560bbf2) with only intensity features selected:
```
docker run -it --mount type=bind,source=/images/collections,target=/data 87f3b560bbf2 --intDir=/data/c1/int --segDir=/data/c1/seg --outDir=/data/output --filePattern=.* --csvfile=separatecsv --features=entropy,kurtosis,skewness,max_intensity,mean_intensity,min_intensity,median,mode,standard_deviation
```



### Install from sources and package into a Docker image

If you want to build your own Nyxus Docker container we provide a convenient shell script:

```
./build-docker.sh
```


## Dependencies
Nyxus is tested with Python 3.6+. Nyxus relies on the the following packages, which are all included as submodules except for LibTIFF:

[NIST Hedgehog](https://github.com/usnistgov/hedgehog) >= 1.0.16 <br>
[NIST Fastloader](https://github.com/usnistgov/FastLoader) >= 2.1.4 <br>
[pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) >= 2.8.1 <br>
[libTIFF](http://www.libtiff.org) >= 3.6.1 <br>

## WIPP Usage

Nyxus is available as plugin for [WIPP](https://isg.nist.gov/deepzoomweb/software/wipp). 

__Label image collection:__
The input should be a labeled image in tiled OME TIFF format (.ome.tif). Extracting morphology features, Feret diameter statistics, neighbors, hexagonality and polygonality scores requires the segmentation labels image. If extracting morphological features is not required, the label image collection can be not specified.

__Intensity image collection:__
Extracting intensity-based features requires intensity image in tiled OME TIFF format. This is an optional parameter - the input for this parameter is required only when intensity-based features needs to be extracted.

__File pattern:__
Enter file pattern to match the intensity and labeled/segmented images to extract features (https://pypi.org/project/filepattern/) Filepattern will sort and process files in the labeled and intensity image folders alphabetically if universal selector(.*.ome.tif) is used. If a more specific file pattern is mentioned as input, it will get matches from labeled image folder and intensity image folder based on the pattern implementation.

__Pixel distance:__
Enter value for this parameter if neighbors touching cells needs to be calculated. The default value is 5. This parameter is optional.

__Features:__
Comma separated list of features to be extracted. If all the features are required, then choose option __*all*__.

__Csvfile:__
There are 2 options available under this category. __*Separatecsv*__ - to save all the features extracted for each image in separate csv file. __*Singlecsv*__ - to save all the features extracted from all the images in the same csv file.

__Embedded pixel size:__
This is an optional parameter. Use this parameter only if units are present in the metadata and want to use those embedded units for the features extraction. If this option is selected, value for the length of unit and pixels per unit parameters are not required.

__Length of unit:__
Unit name for conversion. This is also an optional parameter. This parameter will be displayed in plugin's WIPP user interface only when embedded pixel size parameter is not selected (ckrresponding check box checked).

__Pixels per unit:__
If there is a metric mentioned in Length of unit, then Pixels per unit cannot be left blank and hence the scale per unit value must be mentioned in this parameter. This parameter will be displayed in plugin's user interface only when embedded pixel size parameter is not selected.

__Note:__ If Embedded pixel size is not selected and values are entered in Length of unit and Pixels per unit, then the metric unit mentioned in length of unit will be considered.
If Embedded pixel size, Length of unit and Pixels per unit is not selected and the unit and pixels per unit fields are left blank, the unit will be assumed to be pixels.

__Output:__
The output is a csv file containing the value of features required.
